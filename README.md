# odin-recipes

Hi I'm nes, 
I'm currently in the middle of the foundations course on the odin project. 

I've been kinda lazy with it the past 2 years due to other commitments, but now
I'm trying to do a little bit every day having continued on from the 7/3/24.

Right now it is the 9/3/24 a saturday, and it's getting to 39 degrees celsius (hooh).
Akira Toriyama has recently passed away, Jord this morning was watching the recent boxing matches: 
ngannou vs anthony joshua | zhang vs parker | not sure who else.
